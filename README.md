# Abacus Cosmos

This repository contains Python 3 interfaces to manipulate the halo catalogs from the Abacus Cosmos project.
Using these interfaces is entirely optional; if you want to write your own code to interact with the raw catalogs,
the binary formats are detailed on the project website.

Download the catalogs here: https://lgarrison.github.io/AbacusCosmos
