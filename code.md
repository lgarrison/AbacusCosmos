# Overview
We provide example Python code to load the FoF and Rockstar halo catalogs and particle subsamples.
The main file is [Halos.py](https://github.com/lgarrison/AbacusCosmos/blob/master/AbacusCosmos/Halos.py);
we also provide [Halotools.py](https://github.com/lgarrison/AbacusCosmos/blob/master/AbacusCosmos/Halotools.py),
which is a thin wrapper around `Halos.py`
that puts the catalogs in [halotools](http://halotools.readthedocs.io/) format.

All the code is available on the [AbacusCosmos GitHub](https://github.com/lgarrison/AbacusCosmos).
Please file an issue there if you find a problem with the code.

Using these interfaces is not necessary; all of the data formats are documented in
[Data Specifications]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link data_specifications.md %}).  But the example
code might help you get started using the catalogs faster or help with implementing your own
code to parse the catalogs.
